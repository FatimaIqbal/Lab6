*****  Local Spider in java  *****

Its a simple program a spider application capable of indexing the local filesystem in java. The spider can crawl through the filesystem, creating an easily searchable
index of file paths, file names & contents.The user gets to enter the the directory in which he wants the system to look for the file. After than he get to choose whether 
he wants to search for files by name or by the contents of the file(this is the case for text files alone). After that the user gets to input a name which he wants to find
either in the contents of a file or in the file name (this depends on his previous choice)The system then searches for that name and prints out in the end its findings.
